# Preconfigured Docker Containers<a name="create_deploy_dockerpreconfig"></a>

Elastic Beanstalk supports Docker containers that are based on the language stacks provided in the [Docker Official Repositories](http://registry.hub.docker.com/official)\. You can use preconfigured Docker containers to develop and test your application locally and then deploy the application in an Elastic Beanstalk environment that is identical to your local environment\.

For an end\-to\-end walkthrough about deploying an application to Elastic Beanstalk using a preconfigured Docker container, see [Getting Started with Preconfigured Docker Containers](create_deploy_dockerpreconfig.walkthrough.md)\.

For more information about supported platforms for preconfigured Docker containers, see [Preconfigured Docker](concepts.platforms.md#concepts.platforms.dockerpreconfig)\.
