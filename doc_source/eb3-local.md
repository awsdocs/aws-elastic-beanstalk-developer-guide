## Description<a name="eb3-localdescription"></a>

Use eb local run to run your application's containers locally in Docker\. Check the application's container status with eb local status\. Open the application in a web browser with eb local open\. Retrieve the location of the application's logs with eb local logs\.

eb local setenv and eb local printenv let you set and view environment variables that are provided to the Docker containers that you run locally with eb local run\.

You must run all eb local commands in the project directory of a Docker application that has been initialized as an EB CLI repository by using eb init\.

**Note**  
Use eb local on a local computer running Linux or macOS\. The command doesn't support Windows\.  
Before using the command on macOS, install Docker for Mac, and ensure that boot2docker isn't installed \(or isn't in the execution path\)\. The eb local command tries to use boot2docker if it's present, but doesn't work well with it on macOS\.

|  Name  |  Description  | 
| --- | --- | 
|  `--envvars key1=value1,key2=value2`  |  Sets environment variables that the EB CLI will pass to the local Docker containers\. In multicontainer environments, all variables are passed to all containers\.  | 
|  `--port hostport`  |  Maps a port on the host to the exposed port on the container\. If you don't specify this option, the EB CLI uses the same port on both host and container\. This option works only with Docker platform applications\. It doesn't apply to the Multicontainer Docker platform\.  |
