# eb terminate<a name="eb3-terminate"></a>

## Description<a name="eb3-terminatedescription"></a>

Terminates the running environment so that you don't incur charges for unused AWS resources\.

Using the `--all` option, deletes the application that the current directory was initialized to using [eb init](eb3-init.md)\. The command terminates all environments in the application\. It also terminates the [application versions](applications-versions.md) and [saved configurations](environment-configuration-savedconfig.md) for the application, and then deletes the application\.

If the root directory contains a `platform.yaml` file specifying a custom platform, this command terminates the running custom environment\.

**Note**  
You can always launch a new environment using the same version later\. If you have data from an environment that you want to preserve, set the database deletion policy to `Retain` before terminating the environment\. This keeps the database operational outside of Elastic Beanstalk\. After this, any Elastic Beanstalk environments must connect to it as an external database\. If you want to back up the data without keeping the database operational, set the deletion policy to take a snapshot of the database before terminating the environment\. For more information, see [Database lifecycle](using-features.managing.db.md#environments-cfg-rds-lifecycle) in the *Configuring environments* chapter of this guide\.
