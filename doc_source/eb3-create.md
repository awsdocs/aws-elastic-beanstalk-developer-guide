# eb create<a name="eb3-create"></a>

## Description<a name="eb3-createdescription"></a>

Creates a new environment and deploys an application version to it\.

**Note**  
To use eb create on a \.NET application, you must create a deployment package as described in [Creating a source bundle for a \.NET application](applications-sourcebundle.md#using-features.deployment.source.dotnet), then set up the CLI configuration to deploy the package as an artifact as described in [Deploying an artifact instead of the project folder](eb-cli3-configuration.md#eb-cli3-artifact)\.
Creating environments with the EB CLI requires a [service role](concepts-roles-service.md)\. You can create a service role by creating an environment in the Elastic Beanstalk console\. If you don't have a service role, the EB CLI attempts to create one when you run `eb create`\.

You can deploy the application version from a few sources:
+ By default: From the application source code in the local project directory\.
+ Using the `--version` option: From an application version that already exists in your application\.
+ When your project directory doesn't have application code, or when using the `--sample` option: Deployed from a sample application, specific to your environment's platform\.

## Syntax<a name="eb3-createsyntax"></a>

eb create

eb create *environment\-name*

An environment name must be between 4 and 40 characters in length\. It can only contain letters, numbers, and hyphens \(\-\)\. An environment name can't begin or end with a hyphen\.

If you include an environment name in the command, the EB CLI doesn't prompt you to make any selections or create a service role\.

If you run the command without an environment name argument, it runs in an interactive flow, and prompts you to enter or select values for some settings\. In this interactive flow, in case you are deploying a sample application, the EB CLI also asks you if you want to download this sample application to your local project directory\. By downloading it, you can use the EB CLI with the new environment later to run operations that require the application's code, such as [eb deploy](eb3-deploy.md)\.

Some interactive flow prompts are displayed only under certain conditions\. For example, if you choose to use an Application Load Balancer, and your account has at least one sharable Application Load Balancer, Elastic Beanstalk displays a prompt that asks if you want to use a shared load balancer\. If no sharable Application Load Balancer exists in your account, this prompt isn't displayed\.

## Options<a name="eb3-createoptions"></a>

None of these options are required\. If you run eb create without any options, the EB CLI prompts you to enter or select a value for each setting\.

Parameter examples: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb3-create.html) You can specify this option only with `--elb-type application`\. If you specify that option and don't specify `--shared-lb`, Elastic Beanstalk creates a dedicated load balancer for the environment\.  | 
|  `-lp` *port* or `--shared-lb-port` *port*  |  The default listener port of the shared load balancer for this environment\. Elastic Beanstalk adds a listener rule that routes all traffic from this listener to the default environment process\. For more information, see [Shared Application Load Balancer](environments-cfg-alb-shared.md)\. Type: Number \(integer\) Default: `80` Valid values: Any integer that represents a listener port of the shared load balancer\.  | 
|  `--single`  |  Create the environment with a single Amazon EC2 instance and without a load balancer\.  A single\-instance environment isn't production ready\. If the instance becomes unstable during deployment, or Elastic Beanstalk terminates and restarts the instance during a configuration update, your application can be unavailable for a period of time\. Use single\-instance environments for development, testing, or staging\. Use load\-balanced environments for production\.   | 
|  `-sm` or `--spot-max-price`  |  The maximum price per unit hour, in US dollars, that you're willing to pay for a Spot Instance\. This option can only be specified with the `--enable-spot` option\.

Valid values: `0.001` to `20.0` For recommendations about maximum price options for Spot Instances, see [Spot Instance pricing history](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-spot-instances-history.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.  | 
|  `-﻿-﻿tags key1=value1[,key2=value2 ...]`  |  Tag the resources in your environment\. Tags are specified as a comma\-separated list of `key=value` pairs\. For more information, see [Tagging environments](using-features.tagging.md)\.  | 
|  `-t worker` or `--tier worker`  | Create a worker environment\. Omit this option to create a web server environment\. | 
|  `--timeout` *minutes*  |  Set number of minutes before the command times out\.  | 
|  `--version` *version\_label*  |  Specifies the application version that you want deployed to the environment instead of the application source code in the local project directory\. Type: String Valid values: An existing application version label  | 
|  `--vpc`  |  Configure a VPC for your environment\. When you include this option, the EB CLI prompts you to enter all required settings prior to launching the environment\.  | 
|  `--vpc.dbsubnets subnet1,subnet2`  |  Specifies subnets for database instances in a VPC\. Required when `--vpc.id` is specified\.  | 
|  `--vpc.ec2subnets subnet1,subnet2`  |  Specifies subnets for Amazon EC2 instances in a VPC\. Required when `--vpc.id` is specified\.  | 
|  `--vpc.elbpublic`  |  Launches your Elastic Load Balancing load balancer in a public subnet in your VPC\. You can't specify this option with the `--tier worker` or `--single` options\.  |

## Output<a name="eb3-createoutput"></a>

If successful, the command prompts you with questions and then returns the status of the create operation\. If there were problems during the launch, you can use the [eb events](eb3-events.md) operation to get more details\.

If you enabled CodeBuild support in your application, eb create displays information from CodeBuild as your code is built\. For information about CodeBuild support in Elastic Beanstalk, see [Using the EB CLI with AWS CodeBuild](eb-cli-codebuild.md)\.
