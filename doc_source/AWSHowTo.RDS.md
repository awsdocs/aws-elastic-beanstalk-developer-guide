# Using Elastic Beanstalk with Amazon Relational Database Service<a name="AWSHowTo.RDS"></a>

AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides support for [running Amazon Relational Database Service \(Amazon RDS\) instances in your Elastic Beanstalk environment](using-features.managing.db.md)\. This works great for development and testing environments\. However, it isn't ideal for a production environment because it ties the lifecycle of the database instance to the lifecycle of your application's environment\.

**Note**  
If you haven't used a DB instance with your application before, try adding one to a test environment with the Elastic Beanstalk console first\. This lets you verify that your application is able to read environment properties, construct a connection string, and connect to a DB instance before you add VPCs and security group configuration to the mix\. See [Adding a Database to Your Elastic Beanstalk Environment](using-features.managing.db.md) for details\.

To decouple your database instance from your environment, you can run a database instance in Amazon RDS and configure your application to connect to it on launch\. This enables you to connect multiple environments to a database, terminate an environment without affecting the database, and perform seamless updates with blue/green deployments\.

To allow the Amazon EC2 instances in your environment to connect to an outside database, you can configure the environment's Auto Scaling group with an additional security group\. The security group that you attach to your environment can be the same one that is attached to your database instance, or a separate security group from which the database's security group allows ingress\.

**Note**  
You can connect your environment to a database by adding a rule to your database's security group that allows ingress from the autogenerated security group that Elastic Beanstalk attaches to your environment's Auto Scaling group\. However, doing so creates a dependency between the two security groups\. Subsequently, when you attempt to terminate the environment, Elastic Beanstalk will be unable to delete the environment's security group because the database's security group is dependent on it\.

After launching your database instance and configuring security groups, you can pass the connection information \(endpoint, password, etc\.\) to your application by using environment properties, the same mechanism that Elastic Beanstalk uses when you run a database instance in your environment\.

For additional security, you can store your connection information in Amazon S3, and configure Elastic Beanstalk to retrieve it during deployment\. With [configuration files \(`.ebextensions`\)](ebextensions.md), you can configure the instances in your environment to securely retrieve files from Amazon S3 when you deploy your application\.

## Launching and Connecting to an External Amazon RDS Instance in a Default VPC<a name="rds-external-defaultvpc"></a>

To use an external database with an application running in Elastic Beanstalk, first launch a DB instance with Amazon RDS\. Any instance that you launch with Amazon RDS is completely independent of Elastic Beanstalk and your Elastic Beanstalk environments, and is not dependent on Elastic Beanstalk for configuration\. This means that you can use any DB engine and instance type supported by Amazon RDS, even those not used by Elastic Beanstalk\.

The following procedures describe the process for a [default VPC](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/default-vpc.html)\. The process is the same if you are using a custom VPC\. The only additional requirements are that your environment and DB instance are in the same subnet, or in subnets that are allowed to communicate with each other\. See [Using Elastic Beanstalk with Amazon Virtual Private Cloud](vpc.md) for details on configuring a custom VPC for use with Elastic Beanstalk\.

**To launch an RDS DB instance in a default VPC**

1. Open the [RDS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home)\.

1. Choose **Instances** in the navigation pane\.

1. Choose **Launch DB Instance**\.

1. Choose a **DB Engine** and preset configuration\.

1. Under **Specify DB Details**, choose a **DB Instance Class**\. For high availability, set **Multi\-AZ Deployment** to **Yes**\.

1. Under **Settings**, enter values for **DB Instance Identifier**, **Master Username**, and **Master Password** \(and **Confirm Password**\)\. Note the values that you entered for later\.

1. Choose **Next**\.

1. For **Network and Security** settings, choose the following:
   + **VPC** – **Default VPC**
   + **Subnet Group** – **default**
   + **Publicly Accessible** – **No**
   + **Availability Zone** – ** No Preference**
   + **VPC Security Groups** – **Default VPC Security Group**

1. For **Database Name**, type **ebdb**, and verify the default settings for the remaining options\. Note the values of the following options:
   + **Database Name**
   + **Database Port**

1. Choose **Launch DB Instance**\.

Next, modify the security group attached to your DB instance to allow inbound traffic on the appropriate port\. This is the same security group that you will attach to your Elastic Beanstalk environment later, so the rule that you add will grant ingress permission to other resources in the same security group\.

**To modify the ingress rules on your RDS instance's security group**

1. Open the [Amazon RDS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home)\.

1. Choose **Instances**\.

1. Choose the arrow next to the entry for your DB instance to expand the view\.

1. Choose the **Details** tab\.

1. In the **Security and Network** section, the security group associated with the DB instance is shown\. Open the link to view the security group in the Amazon EC2 console\.  
![\[Details tab of a DB instance page in the Amazon RDS console\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/images/rds-securitygroup.png)
**Note**  
While you have the **Details** tab open, note the **Endpoint** and security group name shown on this page for use later\.  
The security group name is the first value of the link shown in **Security Groups**, before the parentheses\. The second value, in parentheses, is the security group ID\.

1. In the security group details, choose the **Inbound** tab\.

1. Choose **Edit**\.

1. Choose **Add Rule**\.

1. For **Type**, choose the DB engine that your application uses\.

1. For **Source**, choose **Custom**, and then type the group ID of the security group\. This allows resources in the security group to receive traffic on the database port from other resources in the same group\.  
![\[Edit inbound rules page for a security group in the Amazon EC2 console\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/images/ec2-securitygroup-rds.png)

1. Choose **Save**\.

Next, add the DB instance's security group to your running environment\. This procedure causes Elastic Beanstalk to reprovision all instances in your environment with the additional security group attached\.

**Note**  
In a custom VPC, use the security group's group ID instead of its group name\.

**To add a security group to your environment**

1. Open the [Elastic Beanstalk console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk)\.

1. Navigate to the [management page](environments-console.md) for your environment\.

1. Choose **Configuration**\.

1. On the **Security** configuration card, choose **Modify**\.

1. For **EC2 security groups**, type a comma after the name of the autogenerated security group, followed by the name of the Amazon RDS DB instance's security group\. It's the name you noted while configuring the security group earlier\.

1. Choose **Save**, and then choose **Apply**\.

1. Read the warning, and then choose **Save**\.

Next, pass the connection information to your environment by using environment properties\. When you [add a DB instance to your environment](using-features.managing.db.md) with the Elastic Beanstalk console, Elastic Beanstalk uses environment properties like **RDS\_HOSTNAME** to pass connection information to your application\. You can use the same properties, which will let you use the same application code with both integrated DB instances and external DB instances, or choose your own property names\.

**To configure environment properties for an Amazon RDS DB instance**

1. Open the [Elastic Beanstalk console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk)\.

1. Navigate to the [management page](environments-console.md) for your environment\.

1. Choose **Configuration**\.

1. On the **Software** configuration card, choose **Modify**\.

1. In the **Environment Properties** section, define the variables that your application reads to construct a connection string\. For compatibility with environments that have an integrated RDS DB instance, use the following:
   + **RDS\_HOSTNAME** – The hostname of the DB instance\.

     Amazon RDS console label – **Endpoint** \(this is the hostname\)
   + **RDS\_PORT** – The port on which the DB instance accepts connections\. The default value varies between DB engines\.

     Amazon RDS console label – **Port**
   + **RDS\_DB\_NAME** – The database name, `ebdb`\.

     Amazon RDS console label – **DB Name**
   + **RDS\_USERNAME** – The user name that you configured for your database\.

     Amazon RDS console label – **Username**
   + **RDS\_PASSWORD** – The password that you configured for your database\.

   Choose the plus symbol \(\+\) to add more properties\.  
![\[Environment Properties section\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/images/environment-cfg-envprops-rds.png)

1. Choose **Save**, and then choose **Apply**\.

If you haven't programmed your application to read environment properties and construct a connection string yet, see the following language\-specific topics for instructions:
+ Java SE – [Connecting to a Database \(Java SE Platforms\)](java-rds.md#java-rds-javase)
+ Java with Tomcat – [Connecting to a Database \(Tomcat Platforms\)](java-rds.md#java-rds-tomcat)

+ Python – [Connecting to a Database](create-deploy-python-rds.md#python-rds-connect)
+ Ruby – [Connecting to a Database](create_deploy_Ruby.rds.md#ruby-rds-connect)

Finally, depending on when your application reads environment variables, you might need to restart the application server on the instances in your environment\.

**To restart your environment's app servers**

1. Open the [Elastic Beanstalk console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk)\.

1. Navigate to the [management page](environments-console.md) for your environment\.

1. Choose **Actions**, and then choose **Restart App Server\(s\)**\.

## Launching and Connecting to an External Amazon RDS Instance in EC2 Classic<a name="rds-external-ec2classic"></a>

If you use EC2 Classic \(no VPC\) with AWS Elastic Beanstalk, the procedure changes slightly due to differences in how security groups work\. In EC2 Classic, DB instances can't use EC2 security groups, so they get a DB security group that works only with Amazon RDS\.

You can add rules to a DB security group that allow ingress from EC2 security groups, but you cannot attach a DB security group to your environment's Auto Scaling group\. To avoid creating a dependency between the DB security group and your environment, you must create a third security group in Amazon EC2, add a rule to grant it ingress in the DB security group, and then assign it to the Auto Scaling group in your Elastic Beanstalk environment\.

**To launch an RDS instance in EC2 Classic \(no VPC\)**

1. Open the [RDS management console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home)\.

1. Choose **Launch a DB Instance**\.

1. Proceed through the wizard until you reach the **Advanced Settings** page\. Note the values that you enter for the following options:
   + **Master Username**
   + **Master Password**

1. For **Network and Security** settings, choose the following:
   + **VPC** – **Not in VPC**\. If this option isn't available, your account might not support [EC2\-Classic](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-supported-platforms.html), or you may have chosen an [instance type that is only available in VPC](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-vpc.html#vpc-only-instance-types)\.
   + **Availability Zone** – **No Preference**
   + **DB Security Group\(s\)** – **Create new Security Group**

1. Configure the remaining options and choose **Launch DB Instance**\. Note the values that you enter for the following options:
   + **Database Name**
   + **Database Port**

In EC2\-Classic, your DB instance will have a DB security group instead of a VPC security group\. You can't attach a DB security group to your Elastic Beanstalk environment, so you need to create a new security group that you can authorize to access the DB instance and attach to your environment\. We will refer to this as a *bridge security group* and name it **webapp\-bridge**\.

**To create a bridge security group**

1. Open the [Amazon EC2 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com//ec2/v2/home)\.

1. Choose **Security Groups** under **Network & Security** in the navigation sidebar\.

1. Choose **Create Security Group**\.

1. For **Security group name**, type **webapp\-bridge**\.

1. For **Description**, type **Provide access to DB instance from Elastic Beanstalk environment instances\.**

1. For **VPC**, select **No VPC**\.

1. Choose **Create**

Next, modify the security group attached to your DB instance to allow inbound traffic from the bridge security group\.

**To modify the ingress rules on your RDS instance's security group**

1. Open the [Amazon RDS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home)\.

1. Choose **Instances**\.

1. Choose the arrow next to the entry for your DB instance to expand the view\.

1. Choose the **Details** tab\.

1. In the **Security and Network** section, the security group associated with the DB instance is shown\. Open the link to view the security group in the Amazon EC2 console\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/images/rds-securitygroup-classic.png)

1. In the security group details, set **Connection Type** to **EC2 Security Group**\.

1. Set **EC2 Security Group Name** to the name of the bridge security group that you created\.

1. Choose **Authorize**\.

Next, add the bridge security group to your running environment\. This procedure requires all instances in your environment to be reprovisioned with the additional security group attached\.

**To add a security group to your environment**

1. Open the [Elastic Beanstalk console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk)\.

1. Navigate to the [management page](environments-console.md) for your environment\.

1. Choose **Configuration**\.

1. On the **Security** configuration card, choose **Modify**\.

1. For **EC2 security groups**, type a comma after the name of the autogenerated security group followed by the name of the bridge security group that you created\.

1. Choose **Save**, and then choose **Apply**\.

1. Read the warning, and then choose **Save**\.

Next, pass the connection information to your environment by using environment properties\. When you [add a DB instance to your environment](using-features.managing.db.md) with the Elastic Beanstalk console, Elastic Beanstalk uses environment properties like **RDS\_HOSTNAME** to pass connection information to your application\. You can use the same properties, which will let you use the same application code with both integrated DB instances and external DB instances, or choose your own property names\.

**To configure environment properties**

1. Open the [Elastic Beanstalk console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk)\.

1. Navigate to the [management page](environments-console.md) for your environment\.

   + **RDS\_PASSWORD** – The **Master Password** that you enter when you add the database to your environment\.
   + **RDS\_HOSTNAME** – The **Endpoint** of the DB instance shown in the Amazon RDS console\. 
   + **RDS\_PORT** – The **Port** shown in the Amazon RDS console\.

   Choose the plus symbol to add additional properties\.

**To restart your environment's app servers**

1. Open the [Elastic Beanstalk console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk)\.

1. Choose **Actions**, and then choose **Restart App Server\(s\)**\.

## Storing the Connection String in Amazon S3<a name="rds-external-credentials"></a>

Providing connection information to your application with environment properties is a good way to keep passwords out of your code, but it's not a perfect solution\. Environment properties are discoverable in the [environment management console](environments-console.md), and can be viewed by any user that has permission to [describe configuration settings](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/api/API_DescribeConfigurationSettings.html) on your environment\. Depending on the platform, environment properties may also appear in [instance logs](using-features.logging.md)\.

You can lock down your connection information by storing it in an Amazon S3 bucket that you control\. The basic steps are as follows:
+ Upload a file that contains your connection string to an Amazon S3 bucket\.
+ Grant the EC2 instance profile permission to read the file\.
+ Configure your application to download the file during deployment\.
+ Read the file in your application code\.

First, create a bucket to store the file that contains your connection string\. For this example, we will use a JSON file that has a single key and value\. The value is a JDBC connection string for a PostgreSQL DB instance in Amazon RDS\.

`beanstalk-database.json`

```
{
  "connection": "jdbc:postgresql://mydb.b5uacpxznijm.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/ebdb?user=username&password=mypassword"
}
```

The highlighted portions of the URL correspond to the endpoint, port, DB name, user name and password for the database\.

**To create a bucket and upload a file**

1. Open the [Amazon S3 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home)\.

1. Choose **Create Bucket**\.

1. Type a **Bucket Name**, and then choose a **Region**\.

1. Choose **Create**\.

1. Open the bucket, and then choose **Upload**

1. Follow the prompts to upload the file\.

By default, your account owns the file and has permission to manage it, but IAM users and roles do not unless you grant them access explicitly\. Grant the instances in your Elastic Beanstalk environment by adding a policy to the [instance profile](concepts-roles-instance.md)\.

The default instance is named `aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role`\. If you're not sure what your instance profile is named, you can find it on the **Configuration** page in the [environment management console](using-features.managing.ec2.md)\.

**To add permissions to the instance profile**

1. Open the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home)\.

1. Choose **Roles**\.

1. Choose **aws\-elasticbeanstalk\-ec2\-role**\.

1. Under **Inline Policies**, choose **Create Role Policy**\. Choose **Custom Policy**\.

1. Add a policy that allows the instance to retrieve the file\.

   ```
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "database",
               "Action": [
                   "s3:GetObject"
               ],
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Resource": [
                   "arn:aws:s3:::my-secret-bucket-123456789012/beanstalk-database.json"
               ]
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

   Replace the bucket and object names with the names of your bucket and object\.

Next, add a [configuration file](ebextensions.md) to your source code that tells Elastic Beanstalk to download the file from Amazon S3 during deployment\.

`~/my-app/.ebextensions/database.config`

```
Resources:
  AWSEBAutoScalingGroup:
    Metadata:
      AWS::CloudFormation::Authentication:
        S3Auth:
          type: "s3"
          buckets: ["my-secret-bucket-123456789012"]
          roleName: "aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role"

files:
  "/tmp/beanstalk-database.json" :
    mode: "000644"
    owner: root
    group: root
    authentication: "S3Auth"
    source: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/my-secret-bucket-123456789012/beanstalk-database.json
```

This configuration file does two things\. The `Resources` key adds an authentication method to your environment's Auto Scaling group metadata that Elastic Beanstalk can use to access Amazon S3\. The `files` key tells Elastic Beanstalk to download the file from Amazon S3 and store it locally in `/tmp/` during deployment\.

Deploy your application with the configuration file in `.ebextensions` folder at the root of your source code\. If you configured permissions correctly, the deployment will succeed and the file will be downloaded to all of the instances in your environment\. If not, the deployment will fail\.

Finally, add code to your application to read the JSON file and use the connection string to connect to the database\. See the following language\-specific topics for more information:
