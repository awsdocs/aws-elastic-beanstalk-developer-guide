Elastic Beanstalk for Ruby makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale your Ruby web applications using Amazon Web Services\. Elastic Beanstalk is available to anyone developing or hosting a web application using Ruby\. This section provides step\-by\-step instructions for deploying a sample application to Elastic Beanstalk using the Elastic Beanstalk command line interface \(EB CLI\), and then updating the application to use the [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) web application frameworks\.

The topics in this chapter assume some knowledge of Elastic Beanstalk environments\. If you haven't used Elastic Beanstalk before, try the [getting started tutorial](GettingStarted.md) to learn the basics\.
