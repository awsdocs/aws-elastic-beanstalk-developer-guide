# Deploying Go Applications to Elastic Beanstalk Applications<a name="create_deploy_go"></a>

AWS Elastic Beanstalk supports applications that are developed using the Go programming language \(sometimes called Golang\)\. Elastic Beanstalk supports both native Go environments and Docker containers that are based on the language stacks provided in the [Docker Official Repositories](http://registry.hub.docker.com/official)\. You can use either of these Elastic Beanstalk environments to develop and test your Go application locally, and then deploy the application in an Elastic Beanstalk environment that is identical to your local environment\.

The topics in this chapter assume some knowledge of Elastic Beanstalk environments\. If you haven't used Elastic Beanstalk before, try the getting started tutorial to learn the basics\.
