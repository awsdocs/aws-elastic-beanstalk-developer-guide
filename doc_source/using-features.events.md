# Viewing an Elastic Beanstalk environment's event stream<a name="using-features.events"></a>

You can use the AWS Management Console to access events and notifications associated with your application\.

**To view events**

1. Open the [Elastic Beanstalk console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk), and in the **Regions** list, select your AWS Region\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Environments**, and then choose the name of your environment from the list\.
**Note**  
If you have many environments, use the search bar to filter the environment list\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Events**\.  
![\[Environment events page of the Elastic Beanstalk console\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/images/environment-events.png)

   The Events page shows a list of all events that have been recorded for the environment\. You can page through the list choosing **<** \(previous\), **>** \(next\), or page numbers\. You can filter the type of events shown by using the **Severity** drop\-down list\.

The [EB CLI](eb-cli3.md) and [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) both provide commands for retrieving events\. If you are managing your environment using the EB CLI, use [eb events](eb3-events.md) to print a list of events\. This command also has a `--follow` option that continues to show new events until you press **Ctrl\+C** to stop output\.

To pull events using the AWS CLI, use the `describe-events` command and specify the environment by name or ID:

 

```
$ aws elasticbeanstalk describe-events --environment-id e-gbjzqccra3
{
    "Events": [
        {
            "ApplicationName": "elastic-beanstalk-example",
            "EnvironmentName": "elasticBeanstalkExa-env",
            "Severity": "INFO",
            "RequestId": "a4c7bfd6-2043-11e5-91e2-9114455c358a",
            "Message": "Environment update completed successfully.",
            "EventDate": "2015-07-01T22:52:12.639Z"
        },
...
```
