# Deploying a sinatra application to Elastic Beanstalk<a name="ruby-sinatra-tutorial"></a>

This walkthrough shows how to deploy a simple [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) web application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk\.

## Prerequisites<a name="ruby-sinatra-tutorial-prereqs"></a>

This tutorial assumes you have knowledge of the basic Elastic Beanstalk operations and the Elastic Beanstalk console\. If you haven't already, follow the instructions in [Getting started using Elastic Beanstalk](GettingStarted.md) to launch your first Elastic Beanstalk environment\.

To follow the procedures in this guide, you will need a command line terminal or shell to run commands\. Commands are shown in listings preceded by a prompt symbol \($\) and the name of the current directory, when appropriate\.

```
~/eb-project$ this is a command
this is output
```

On Linux and macOS, you can use your preferred shell and package manager\. On Windows 10, you can [install the Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to get a Windows\-integrated version of Ubuntu and Bash\.

Sinatra 2\.1\.0 requires Ruby 2\.3\.0 or newer\. In this tutorial we use Ruby 3\.0\.2 and the corresponding Elastic Beanstalk platform version\. Install Ruby by following the instructions at [Setting up your Ruby development environment](ruby-development-environment.md)\.

## Launch an Elastic Beanstalk environment<a name="ruby-sinatra-tutorial-launch"></a>

Use the Elastic Beanstalk console to create an Elastic Beanstalk environment\. Choose the **Ruby** platform and accept the default settings and sample code\.

**To launch an environment \(console\)**

1. Open the Elastic Beanstalk console using this preconfigured link: [console\.aws\.amazon\.com/elasticbeanstalk/home\#/newApplication?applicationName=tutorials&environmentType=LoadBalanced](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/home#/newApplication?applicationName=tutorials&environmentType=LoadBalanced)

1. For **Platform**, select the platform and platform branch that match the language used by your application\.

1. For **Application code**, choose **Sample application**\.

1. Choose **Review and launch**\.

1. Review the available options\. Choose the available option you want to use, and when you're ready, choose **Create app**\.

Environment creation takes about 5 minutes and creates the following resources:
+ **EC2 instance** – An Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) virtual machine configured to run web apps on the platform that you choose\.

  Each platform runs a specific set of software, configuration files, and scripts to support a specific language version, framework, web container, or combination of these\. Most platforms use either Apache or NGINX as a reverse proxy that sits in front of your web app, forwards requests to it, serves static assets, and generates access and error logs\.
**Important**  
The *Let's Encrypt* cross\-signed DST Root CA X3 certificate *expired* on *September 30, 2021*\. Due to this, Beanstalk environments running on the Amazon Linux 2 and Amazon Linux AMI operating systems might not be able to connect to servers using *Let's Encrypt* certificates\.  
On October 3, 2021 Elastic Beanstalk released new platform versions for Amazon Linux AMI and Amazon Linux 2 with the updated CA certificates\. To receive these updates and address this issue turn on [Managed Updates](environment-platform-update-managed.md) or [update your platforms manually](using-features.platform.upgrade.md#using-features.platform.upgrade.config)\. For more information, see the [platform update release notes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/relnotes/release-2021-10-03-linux.html) in the *AWS Elastic Beanstalk Release Notes*\.  
You can also apply the manual workarounds described in this [AWS Knowledge Center article](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-expired-certificate/)\. Since Elastic Beanstalk provides AMIs with locked GUIDs, we recommend that you use the sudo yum install command in the article\. Alternatively, you can also use the sudo sed command in the article if you prefer to manually modify the system in place\.
+ **Instance security group** – An Amazon EC2 security group configured to allow inbound traffic on port 80\. This resource lets HTTP traffic from the load balancer reach the EC2 instance running your web app\. By default, traffic isn't allowed on other ports\.
+ **Load balancer** – An Elastic Load Balancing load balancer configured to distribute requests to the instances running your application\. A load balancer also eliminates the need to expose your instances directly to the internet\.
+ **Load balancer security group** – An Amazon EC2 security group configured to allow inbound traffic on port 80\. This resource lets HTTP traffic from the internet reach the load balancer\. By default, traffic isn't allowed on other ports\.
+ **Auto Scaling group** – An Auto Scaling group configured to replace an instance if it is terminated or becomes unavailable\.
+ **Amazon S3 bucket** – A storage location for your source code, logs, and other artifacts that are created when you use Elastic Beanstalk\.
+ **Amazon CloudWatch alarms** – Two CloudWatch alarms that monitor the load on the instances in your environment and that are triggered if the load is too high or too low\. When an alarm is triggered, your Auto Scaling group scales up or down in response\.
+ **AWS CloudFormation stack** – Elastic Beanstalk uses AWS CloudFormation to launch the resources in your environment and propagate configuration changes\. The resources are defined in a template that you can view in the [AWS CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation)\.
+ **Domain name** – A domain name that routes to your web app in the form **subdomain*\.*region*\.elasticbeanstalk\.com*\.

All of these resources are managed by Elastic Beanstalk\. When you terminate your environment, Elastic Beanstalk terminates all the resources that it contains\.

**Note**  
The Amazon S3 bucket that Elastic Beanstalk creates is shared between environments and is not deleted during environment termination\. For more information, see [Using Elastic Beanstalk with Amazon S3](AWSHowTo.S3.md)\.

## Write a basic sinatra website<a name="ruby-sinatra-tutorial-generate"></a>

**To create and deploy a sinatra application**

1. Create a configuration file named **config\.ru** with the following contents\.  
**Example config\.ru**  

   ```
   require './helloworld'
   run Sinatra::Application
   ```

1. Create a Ruby code file named **helloworld\.rb** with the following contents\.  
**Example helloworld\.rb**  

   ```
   require 'sinatra'
   get '/' do
     "Hello World!"
   end
   ```

1. Create a **Gemfile** with the following contents\.  
**Example Gemfile**  

   ```
   source 'https://rubygems.org'
   gem 'sinatra'
   gem 'puma'
   ```

1. Run bundle install to generate the `Gemfile.lock`  
**Example**  

   ```
   ~/eb-sinatra$ bundle install
   Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/....
   Resolving dependencies...
   Using bundler 2.2.22
   Using rack 2.2.3
   ...
   ```

1. In order for Elastic Beanstalk to successfully deploy the application on the Ruby platform, we need to update `Gemfile.lock`\. Some dependencies of `Gemfile.lock ` might be platform specific\. Therefore, we need to add **platform ruby** to `Gemfile.lock` so that all required dependencies are installed with the deployment\.  
**Example**  

   ```
   ~/eb-sinatra$ bundle lock --add-platform ruby
   Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/....
   Resolving dependencies...
   Writing lockfile to /Users/janedoe/EBDPT/RubyApps/eb-sinatra/Gemfile.lock
   ```

1. Create a Procfile with the following contents\.  
**Example Procfile**  

   ```
   web: bundle exec puma -C /opt/elasticbeanstalk/config/private/pumaconf.rb
   ```

## Deploy your application<a name="ruby-sinatra-tutorial-deploy"></a>

Create a [source bundle](applications-sourcebundle.md) containing the your source files\. The following command creates a source bundle named `sinatra-default.zip`\.

```
~/eb-sinatra$ zip ../sinatra-default.zip -r * .[^.]*
```

Upload the source bundle to Elastic Beanstalk to deploy Sinatra to your environment\.

**To deploy a source bundle**

1. Open the [Elastic Beanstalk console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk), and in the **Regions** list, select your AWS Region\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Environments**, and then choose the name of your environment from the list\.
**Note**  
If you have many environments, use the search bar to filter the environment list\.

1. On the environment overview page, choose **Upload and deploy**\.

1. Use the on\-screen dialog box to upload the source bundle\.

1. Choose **Deploy**\.

1. When the deployment completes, you can choose the site URL to open your website in a new tab\.

## Cleanup<a name="ruby-sinatra-tutorial-cleanup"></a>

When you finish working with Elastic Beanstalk, you can terminate your environment\. Elastic Beanstalk terminates all AWS resources associated with your environment, such as [Amazon EC2 instances](using-features.managing.ec2.md), [database instances](using-features.managing.db.md), [load balancers](using-features.managing.elb.md), security groups, and [alarms](using-features.alarms.md#using-features.alarms.title)\. 

**To terminate your Elastic Beanstalk environment**

1. Open the [Elastic Beanstalk console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk), and in the **Regions** list, select your AWS Region\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Environments**, and then choose the name of your environment from the list\.
**Note**  
If you have many environments, use the search bar to filter the environment list\.

1. Choose **Environment actions**, and then choose **Terminate environment**\.

1. Use the on\-screen dialog box to confirm environment termination\.

With Elastic Beanstalk, you can easily create a new environment for your application at any time\.

As you continue to develop your application, you'll probably want a way to manage environments and deploy your application without manually creating a \.zip file and uploading it to the Elastic Beanstalk console\. The [Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface](eb-cli3.md) \(EB CLI\) provides easy\-to\-use commands for creating, configuring, and deploying applications to Elastic Beanstalk environments from the command line\.

Finally, if you plan on using your application in a production environment, you will want to [configure a custom domain name](customdomains.md) for your environment and [enable HTTPS](configuring-https.md) for secure connections\.
