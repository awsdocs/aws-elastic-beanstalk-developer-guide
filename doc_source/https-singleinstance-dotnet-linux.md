# Terminating HTTPS on Amazon EC2 instances running \.NET Core on Linux<a name="https-singleinstance-dotnet-linux"></a>

For \.NET Core on Linux container types, you enable HTTPS with an `.ebextensions` [configuration file](ebextensions.md), and an nginx configuration file that configures the nginx server to use HTTPS\.

Add the following snippet to your configuration file, replacing the certificate and private key placeholders as instructed, and save it in the `.ebextensions` directory\. The configuration file performs the following tasks:
+ The `files` key creates the following files on the instance:  
`/etc/pki/tls/certs/server.crt`  
Creates the certificate file on the instance\. Replace *certificate file contents* with the contents of your certificate\.  
YAML relies on consistent indentation\. Match the indentation level when replacing content in an example configuration file and ensure that your text editor uses spaces, not tab characters, to indent\.
If you have intermediate certificates, include them in `server.crt` after your site certificate\.  

  ```
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    certificate file contents
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    first intermediate certificate
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    second intermediate certificate
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  ```  
`/etc/pki/tls/certs/server.key`  
Creates the private key file on the instance\. Replace *private key contents* with the contents of the private key used to create the certificate request or self\-signed certificate\. 
+ The `container_commands` key restarts the nginx server after everything is configured so that the server loads the nginx configuration file\.

**Example \.ebextensions/https\-instance\.config**  

```
files:
  /etc/pki/tls/certs/server.crt:
    content: |
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      certificate file contents
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
      
  /etc/pki/tls/certs/server.key:
    content: |      
      -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
      private key contents # See note below.
      -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

container_commands:
  01restart_nginx:
    command: "systemctl restart nginx"
```

**Note**  
Avoid committing a configuration file that contains your private key to source control\. After you have tested the configuration and confirmed that it works, store your private key in Amazon S3 and modify the configuration to download it during deployment\. For instructions, see [Storing private keys securely in Amazon S3](https-storingprivatekeys.md)\.

Place the following in a file with the `.conf` extension in the `.ebextensions/nginx/conf.d/` directory of your source bundle \(for example, `.ebextensions/nginx/conf.d/https.conf`\)\. Replace *app\_port* with the port number that your application listens on\. This example configures the nginx server to listen on port 443 using SSL\. For more information about these configuration files on the \.NET Core on Linux platform, see [Using the \.NET Core on Linux platform](dotnet-linux-platform.md)\.

**Note**
Make sure the \.conf files are UTF-8 encoded and NOT UTF-8-BOM.

**Example \.ebextensions/nginx/conf\.d/https\.conf**  

```
# HTTPS server

server {
    listen       443;
    server_name  localhost;
    
    ssl                  on;
    ssl_certificate      /etc/pki/tls/certs/server.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key  /etc/pki/tls/certs/server.key;
    
    ssl_session_timeout  5m;
    
    ssl_protocols  TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers   on;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass  http://localhost:app_port;
        proxy_set_header   Connection "";
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header        Host            $host;
        proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP       $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Proto https;
    }
}
```

In a single instance environment, you must also modify the instance's security group to allow traffic on port 443\. The following configuration file retrieves the security group's ID using an AWS CloudFormation [function](ebextensions-functions.md) and adds a rule to it\.

**Example \.ebextensions/https\-instance\-single\.config**  

```
Resources:
  sslSecurityGroupIngress: 
    Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroupIngress
    Properties:
      GroupId: {"Fn::GetAtt" : ["AWSEBSecurityGroup", "GroupId"]}
      IpProtocol: tcp
      ToPort: 443
      FromPort: 443
      CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
```

For a load\-balanced environment, you configure the load balancer to either [pass secure traffic through untouched](https-tcp-passthrough.md), or [decrypt and re\-encrypt](configuring-https-endtoend.md) for end\-to\-end encryption\.
