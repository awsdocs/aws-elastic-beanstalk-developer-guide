# Platform specific options<a name="command-options-specific"></a>

Some Elastic Beanstalk platforms define option namespaces that are specific to the platform\. These namespaces and their options are listed below for each platform\.

**Note**  
Previously, in platform versions based on Amazon Linux AMI \(preceding Amazon Linux 2\), the following two features and their respective namespaces were considered to be platform\-specific features, and were listed here per platform:  
**Proxy configuration for static files** – `aws:elasticbeanstalk:environment:proxy:staticfiles`
**AWS X\-Ray support** – `aws:elasticbeanstalk:xray`
In Amazon Linux 2 platform versions, Elastic Beanstalk implements these features in a consistent way across all supporting platforms\. The related namespace are now listed in the [General options for all environments](command-options-general.md) page\. We only kept mention of them on this page for platforms who had differently\-named namespaces\.

## Docker platform options<a name="command-options-docker"></a>

The following Docker\-specific configuration options apply to the Docker and Preconfigured Docker platforms\.

**Note**  
These configuration options do not apply to  
the Docker platform \(Amazon Linux 2\) with Docker Compose
the Multicontainer Docker platform \(Amazon Linux AMI\)


**Namespace: `aws:elasticbeanstalk:environment:proxy`**  

|  **Name**  |  **Description**  |  **Default**  |  **Valid values**  | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|  ProxyServer  |  Specifies the web server to use as a proxy\.  |  `nginx`  |  `nginx` `none` – *Amazon Linux AM* and *Docker w/DC only*  | 

## Go platform options<a name="command-options-golang"></a>

### Amazon Linux AMI \(pre\-Amazon Linux 2\) platform options<a name="command-options-golang.alami"></a>

#### Namespace: `aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:golang:staticfiles`<a name="command-options-golang.alami.staticfiles"></a>

You can use the following namespace to configure the proxy server to serve static files\. When the proxy server receives a request for a file under the specified path, it serves the file directly instead of routing the request to your application\. This reduces the number of requests that your application has to process\.

Map a path served by the proxy server to a folder in your source code that contains static assets\. Each option that you define in this namespace maps a different path\.


|  **Name**  |  **Value**  | 
| --- | --- | 
|  Path where the proxy server will serve the files\. Example: `/images` to serve files at `subdomain.eleasticbeanstalk.com/images`\.  |  Name of the folder containing the files\. Example: `staticimages` to serve files from a folder named `staticimages` at the top level of your source bundle\.  |

|  ProxyServer  |  Set the proxy to use on your environment's instances\. If you set this option to `apache`, Elastic Beanstalk uses [Apache 2\.4](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/)\. Set to `apache/2.2` if your application isn't ready to migrate away from [Apache 2\.2](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/) due to incompatible proxy configuration settings\. *This value is only valid on Amazon Linux AMI \(preceding Amazon Linux 2\) platform versions\.* Set to `nginx` to use [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)\. This is the default starting with Amazon Linux 2 platform versions\.

|  NodeVersion  |  Version of Node\.js\. For example, `4.4.6` Supported Node\.js versions vary between Node\.js platform versions\. See [Node\.js](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/platforms/platforms-supported.html#platforms-supported.nodejs) in the *AWS Elastic Beanstalk Platforms* document for a list of the currently supported versions\.  When support for the version of Node\.js that you are using is removed from the platform, you must change or remove the version setting prior to doing a [platform update](using-features.platform.upgrade.md)\. This might occur when a security vulnerability is identified for one or more versions of Node\.js\. When this happens, attempting to update to a new version of the platform that doesn't support the configured [NodeVersion](#command-options-nodejs) fails\. To avoid needing to create a new environment, change the *NodeVersion* configuration option to a Node\.js version that is supported by both the old platform version and the new one, or [remove the option setting](environment-configuration-methods-after.md), and then perform the platform update\.   | varies | varies |

|  ProxyServer  |  Specifies which web server should be used to proxy connections to Node\.js\. If ProxyServer is set to `none`, then static file mappings doesn't take effect and gzip compression is disabled\.  |  `nginx`  |  `apache` `nginx` `none`  |
