# Enhanced health reporting and monitoring<a name="health-enhanced"></a>

Enhanced health reporting is a feature that you can enable on your environment to allow AWS Elastic Beanstalk to gather additional information about resources in your environment\. Elastic Beanstalk analyzes the information gathered to provide a better picture of overall environment health and aid in the identification of issues that can cause your application to become unavailable\.

In addition to changes in how health color works, enhanced health adds a *status* descriptor that provides an indicator of the severity of issues observed when an environment is yellow or red\. When more information is available about the current status, you can choose the **Causes** button to view detailed health information on the [health page](health-enhanced-console.md)\.

![\[The Elastic Beanstalk environment overview page of the Elastic Beanstalk console showing an enhanced health status\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/images/enhanced-health-dashboard-cause.png)

To provide detailed health information about the Amazon EC2 instances running in your environment, Elastic Beanstalk includes a [health agent](#health-enhanced-agent) in the Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\) for each platform version that supports enhanced health\. The health agent monitors web server logs and system metrics and relays them to the Elastic Beanstalk service\. Elastic Beanstalk analyzes these metrics and data from Elastic Load Balancing and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to provide an overall picture of an environment's health\.

In addition to collecting and presenting information about your environment's resources, Elastic Beanstalk monitors the resources in your environment for several error conditions and provides notifications to help you avoid failures and resolve configuration issues\. [Factors that influence your environment's health](#health-enhanced-factors) include the results of each request served by your application, metrics from your instances' operating system, and the status of the most recent deployment\.

You can view health status in real time by using the [environment overview](health-enhanced-console.md) page of the Elastic Beanstalk console or the [eb health](health-enhanced-ebcli.md) command in the [Elastic Beanstalk command line interface](eb-cli3.md) \(EB CLI\)\. To record and track environment and instance health over time, you can configure your environment to publish the information gathered by Elastic Beanstalk for enhanced health reporting to Amazon CloudWatch as custom metrics\. CloudWatch [charges](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/) for custom metrics apply to all metrics other than `EnvironmentHealth`, which is free of charge\.

Enhanced health reporting requires a version 2 or newer [ platform version](concepts.platforms.md)\. To monitor resources and publish metrics, your environment must have both an [instance profile and service](#health-enhanced) role\. The Multicontainer Docker platform doesn't include a web server by default, but can be used with enhanced health reporting if you configure your web server to [provide logs in the proper format](health-enhanced-serverlogs.md)\.

**Windows platform notes**  
This feature isn't available on [Windows Server platform versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/platforms/platforms-supported.html#platforms-supported.net) earlier than version 2 \(v2\)\.
When you enable enhanced health reporting on a Windows Server environment, don't change [IIS logging configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/manage/provisioning-and-managing-iis/configure-logging-in-iis)\. For enhanced health monitoring to work correctly, IIS logging must be configured with the **W3C** format and the **ETW event only** or **Both log file and ETW event** log event destinations\.  
In addition, don't disable or stop the [Elastic Beanstalk health agent](#health-enhanced-agent) Windows service on any of your environment's instances\. To collect and report enhanced health information on an instance, this service should be enabled and running\.

Enhanced health requires the environment to have an instance profile\. The instance profile should have roles that provide permissions for your environment instances to collect and report enhanced health information\. The first time you create an environment with a v2 platform version in the Elastic Beanstalk console, Elastic Beanstalk prompts you to create the required roles and enables enhanced health reporting by default\. Continue reading for details on how enhanced health reporting works, or see [Enabling Elastic Beanstalk enhanced health reporting](health-enhanced-enable.md) to get started using it right away\.

Amazon Linux 2 platforms require instance profiles, so they can support enhanced health unconditionally\. When you create an environment using an Amazon Linux 2 platform, Elastic Beanstalk always enables enhanced health\. This is true regardless of how you create the environmentâ€”using the Elastic Beanstalk console, the EB CLI, the AWS CLI, or the API\.

## The Elastic Beanstalk health agent<a name="health-enhanced-agent"></a>

The Elastic Beanstalk health agent is a daemon process \(or service, on Windows environments\) that runs on each Amazon EC2 instance in your environment, monitoring operating system and application\-level health metrics and reporting issues to Elastic Beanstalk\. The health agent is included in all platform versions starting with version 2\.0 of each platform\.

The health agent reports similar metrics to those [published to CloudWatch](using-features.healthstatus.md#monitoring-basic-cloudwatch) by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing as part of [basic health reporting](using-features.healthstatus.md), including CPU load, HTTP codes, and latency\. The health agent, however, reports directly to Elastic Beanstalk, with greater granularity and frequency than basic health reporting\.

For basic health, these metrics are published every five minutes and can be monitored with graphs in the environment management console\. With enhanced health, the Elastic Beanstalk health agent reports metrics to Elastic Beanstalk every 10 seconds\. Elastic Beanstalk uses the metrics provided by the health agent to determine the health status of each instance in the environment and, combined with other [factors](#health-enhanced-factors), to determine the overall health of the environment\. 

The overall health of the environment can be viewed in real time in the environment overview page of the Elastic Beanstalk console, and is published to CloudWatch by Elastic Beanstalk every 60 seconds\. You can view detailed metrics reported by the health agent in real time with the [eb health](health-enhanced-ebcli.md) command in the [EB CLI](eb-cli3.md)\.

For an additional charge, you can choose to publish individual instance and environment\-level metrics to CloudWatch every 60 seconds\. Metrics published to CloudWatch can then be used to create [monitoring graphs](environment-health-console.md#environment-health-console-customize) in the [environment management console](environments-console.md)\. 

Enhanced health reporting only incurs a charge if you choose to publish enhanced health metrics to CloudWatch\. When you use enhanced health, you still get the basic health metrics published for free, even if you don't choose to publish enhanced health metrics\. 

See [Instance metrics](health-enhanced-metrics.md) for details on the metrics reported by the health agent\. For details on publishing enhanced health metrics to CloudWatch, see [Publishing Amazon CloudWatch custom metrics for an environment](health-enhanced-cloudwatch.md)\.

## Factors in determining instance and environment health<a name="health-enhanced-factors"></a>

In addition to the basic health reporting system checks, including [Elastic Load Balancing health checks](using-features.healthstatus.md#using-features.healthstatus.understanding) and [resource monitoring](using-features.healthstatus.md#monitoring-basic-additionalchecks), Elastic Beanstalk enhanced health reporting gathers additional data about the state of the instances in your environment\. This includes operating system metrics, server logs, and the state of ongoing environment operations such as deployments and updates\. The Elastic Beanstalk health reporting service combines information from all available sources and analyzes it to determine the overall health of the environment\.



### Operations and commands<a name="health-enhanced-factors-operations"></a>

When you perform an operation on your environment, such as deploying a new version of an application, Elastic Beanstalk makes several changes that affect the environment's health status\.

For example, when you deploy a new version of an application to an environment that is running multiple instances, you might see messages similar to the following as you monitor the environment's health [with the EB CLI](health-enhanced-ebcli.md)\.

```
  id             status     cause
    Overall      Info       Command is executing on 3 out of 5 instances
  i-bb65c145     Pending    91 % of CPU is in use. 24 % in I/O wait
                            Performing application deployment (running for 31 seconds)
  i-ba65c144     Pending    Performing initialization (running for 12 seconds)
  i-f6a2d525     Ok         Application deployment completed 23 seconds ago and took 26 seconds
  i-e8a2d53b     Pending    94 % of CPU is in use. 52 % in I/O wait
                            Performing application deployment (running for 33 seconds)
  i-e81cca40     Ok
```

In this example, the overall status of the environment is `Ok` and the cause of this status is that the *Command is executing on 3 out of 5 instances*\. Three of the instances in the environment have the status *Pending*, indicating that an operation is in progress\.

When an operation completes, Elastic Beanstalk reports additional information about the operation\. For the example, Elastic Beanstalk displays the following information about an instance that has already been updated with the new version of the application:

```
i-f6a2d525     Ok         Application deployment completed 23 seconds ago and took 26 seconds
```

Instance health information also includes details about the most recent deployment to each instance in your environment\. Each instance reports a deployment ID and status\. The deployment ID is an integer that increases by one each time you deploy a new version of your application or change settings for on\-instance configuration options, such as environment variables\. You can use the deployment information to identify instances that are running the wrong version of your application after a failed [rolling deployment](using-features.rolling-version-deploy.md)\.

In the cause column, Elastic Beanstalk includes informational messages about successful operations and other healthy states across multiple health checks, but they don't persist indefinitely\. Causes for unhealthy environment statuses persist until the environment returns to a healthy status\.

### Command timeout<a name="health-enhanced-factors-timeout"></a>

Elastic Beanstalk applies a command timeout from the time an operation begins to allow an instance to transition into a healthy state\. This command timeout is set in your environment's update and deployment configuration \(in the [aws:elasticbeanstalk:command](command-options-general.md#command-options-general-elasticbeanstalkcommand) namespace\) and defaults to 10 minutes\. 

During rolling updates, Elastic Beanstalk applies a separate timeout to each batch in the operation\. This timeout is set as part of the environment's rolling update configuration \(in the [aws:autoscaling:updatepolicy:rollingupdate](command-options-general.md#command-options-general-autoscalingupdatepolicyrollingupdate) namespace\)\. If all instances in the batch are healthy within the command timeout, the operation continues to the next batch\. If not, the operation fails\.

**Note**  
If your application does not pass health checks with an **OK** status but is stable at a different level, you can set the `HealthCheckSuccessThreshold` option in the [`aws:elasticbeanstalk:command namespace`](command-options-general.md#command-options-general-elasticbeanstalkcommand) to change the level at which Elastic Beanstalk considers an instance to be healthy\.

For a web server environment to be considered healthy, each instance in the environment or batch must pass 12 consecutive health checks over the course of two minutes\. For a worker tier environment, each instance must pass 18 health checks\. Before the command times out, Elastic Beanstalk doesn't lower an environment's health status when health checks fail\. If the instances in the environment become healthy within the command timeout, the operation succeeds\.

### HTTP requests<a name="health-enhanced-factors-requests"></a>

When no operation is in progress on an environment, the primary source of information about instance and environment health is the web server logs for each instance\. To determine the health of an instance and the overall health of the environment, Elastic Beanstalk considers the number of requests, the result of each request, and the speed at which each request was resolved\.

On Linux\-based platforms, Elastic Beanstalk reads and parses web server logs to get information about HTTP requests\. On the Windows Server platform, Elastic Beanstalk receives this information [directly from the IIS web server](health-enhanced-metrics-server-iis.md)\.

Your environment might not have an active web server\. For example, the Multicontainer Docker platform doesn't include a web server\. Other platforms include a web server, and your application might disable it\. In these cases, your environment requires additional configuration to provide the [Elastic Beanstalk health agent](#health-enhanced-agent) with logs in the format that it needs to relay health information to the Elastic Beanstalk service\. See [Enhanced health log format](health-enhanced-serverlogs.md) for details\.

### Operating system metrics<a name="health-enhanced-factors-healthcheck"></a>

Elastic Beanstalk monitors operating system metrics reported by the health agent to identify instances that are consistently low on system resources\.

See [Instance metrics](health-enhanced-metrics.md) for details on the metrics reported by the health agent\.

## Health check rule customization<a name="health-enhanced.rules"></a>

Elastic Beanstalk enhanced health reporting relies on a set of rules to determine the health of your environment\. Some of these rules might not be appropriate for your particular application\. A common case is an application that returns frequent HTTP 4xx errors by design\. Elastic Beanstalk, using one of its default rules, concludes that something is going wrong, and changes your environment health status from OK to Warning, Degraded, or Severe, depending on the error rate\. To handle this case correctly, Elastic Beanstalk allows you to configure this rule and ignore application HTTP 4xx errors\. For details, see [Configuring enhanced health rules for an environment](health-enhanced-rules.md)\.

## Enhanced health roles<a name="health-enhanced-roles"></a>

Enhanced health reporting requires two rolesâ€”a service role for Elastic Beanstalk and an instance profile for the environment\. The service role allows Elastic Beanstalk to interact with other AWS services on your behalf to gather information about the resources in your environment\. The instance profile allows the instances in your environment to write logs to Amazon S3 and to communicate enhanced health information to the Elastic Beanstalk service\.

When you create an Elastic Beanstalk environment using the Elastic Beanstalk console or the EB CLI, Elastic Beanstalk creates a default service role and attaches required managed policies to a default instance profile for your environment\.

If you use the API, an SDK, or the AWS CLI to create environments, you must create these roles in advance, and specify them during environment creation to use enhanced health\. For instructions on creating appropriate roles for your environments, see [Service roles, instance profiles, and user policies](concepts-roles.md)\.

We recommend that you use *managed policies* for your instance profile and service role\. Managed policies are AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) policies that Elastic Beanstalk maintains\. Using managed policies guarantees that your environment has all permissions it needs to function properly\.

For the instance profile, you can use the `AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier` or `AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier` managed policy, for a [web server tier](concepts-webserver.md) or [worker tier](concepts-worker.md) environment, respectively\. For details about these two managed instance profile policies, see [Managing Elastic Beanstalk instance profiles](iam-instanceprofile.md)\.

## Enhanced health authorization<a name="health-enhanced-authz"></a>

The Elastic Beanstalk instance profile managed policies contain permissions for the `elasticbeanstalk:PutInstanceStatistics` action\. This action isn't part of the Elastic Beanstalk API\. It's part of a different API that environment instances use internally to communicate enhanced health information to the Elastic Beanstalk service\. You don't call this API directly\.

When you create a new environment, authorization for the `elasticbeanstalk:PutInstanceStatistics` action is enabled by default\. To increase security of your environment and help prevent health data spoofing on your behalf, we recommend that you keep authorization for this action enabled\. If you use managed policies for your instance profile, this feature is available for your new environment without any further configuration\. However, If you use a *custom instance profile* instead of a *managed policy*, your environment might display a **No Data** health status\. This happens because the instances aren't authorized for the action that communicates enhanced health data to the service\.

To authorize the action, include the following statement in your instance profile\.

```
    {
      "Sid": "ElasticBeanstalkHealthAccess",
      "Action": [
        "elasticbeanstalk:PutInstanceStatistics"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:elasticbeanstalk:*:*:application/*",
        "arn:aws:elasticbeanstalk:*:*:environment/*"
      ]
    }
```

If you donâ€™t want to use enhanced health authorization at this time, disable it by setting set the `EnhancedHealthAuthEnabled` option in the [aws:elasticbeanstalk:healthreporting:system](command-options-general.md#command-options-general-elasticbeanstalkhealthreporting) namespace to `false`\. If this option is disabled, the permissions described previously arenâ€™t required\. You can remove them from the instance profile for [ least privilege access](security-best-practices.md#security-best-practices.preventive.least-priv) to your applications and environments\. 

**Note**  
Previously the default setting for `EnhancedHealthAuthEnabled` was `false`, which resulted in authorization for the `elasticbeanstalk:PutInstanceStatistics` action also being disabled by default\. To enable this action for an existing environment, set the `EnhancedHealthAuthEnabled` option in the [aws:elasticbeanstalk:healthreporting:system](command-options-general.md#command-options-general-elasticbeanstalkhealthreporting) namespace to `true`\. You can configure this option by using an [option setting](ebextensions-optionsettings.md) in a [configuration file](ebextensions.md)\. 

## Enhanced health events<a name="health-enhanced-events"></a>

The enhanced health system generates events when an environment transitions between states\. The following example shows events output by an environment transitioning between **Info**, **OK**, and **Severe** states\.

![\[The Elastic Beanstalk environment overview page of the Elastic Beanstalk console showing enhanced health recent events\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/images/enhanced-health-events.png)

When transitioning to a worse state, the enhanced health event includes a message indicating the transition cause\.

Not all changes in status at an instance level cause Elastic Beanstalk to emit an event\. To prevent false alarms, Elastic Beanstalk generates a health\-related event only if an issue persists across multiple checks\.

Real\-time environment\-level health information, including status, color, and cause, is available in the [environment overview](environments-console.md#environments-dashboard) page of the Elastic Beanstalk console and the [EB CLI](eb-cli3.md)\. By attaching the EB CLI to your environment and running the [eb health](health-enhanced-ebcli.md) command, you can also view real\-time statuses from each of the instances in your environment\.

## Enhanced health reporting behavior during updates, deployments, and scaling<a name="health-enhanced-effects"></a>

Enabling enhanced health reporting can affect how your environment behaves during configuration updates and deployments\. Elastic Beanstalk won't complete a batch of updates until all of the instances pass health checks consistently\. Also, because enhanced health reporting applies a higher standard for health and monitors more factors, instances that pass basic health reporting's [ELB health check](using-features.healthstatus.md#using-features.healthstatus.understanding) won't necessarily pass with enhanced health reporting\. See the topics on [rolling configuration updates](using-features.rollingupdates.md) and [rolling deployments](using-features.rolling-version-deploy.md) for details on how health checks affect the update process\.

Enhanced health reporting can also highlight the need to set a proper [health check URL](environments-cfg-clb.md#using-features.managing.elb.healthchecks) for Elastic Load Balancing\. When your environment scales up to meet demand, new instances will start taking requests as soon as they pass enough ELB health checks\. If a health check URL is not configured, this can be as little as 20 seconds after a new instance is able to accept a TCP connection\.

If your application hasn't finished starting up by the time the load balancer declares it healthy enough to receive traffic, you will see a flood of failed requests, and your environment will start to fail health checks\. A health check URL that hits a path served by your application can prevent this issue\. ELB health checks won't pass until a GET request to the health check URL returns a 200 status code\.
