# Troubleshooting<a name="troubleshooting"></a>

This chapter provides a table of the most common Elastic Beanstalk issues and describes how to resolve or work around them\. Error messages can appear as events on the environment management page in the console, in logs, or on the health page\.

If the health of your environment changes to red, try the following:
+ Review recent environment [events](using-features.events.md)\. Messages from Elastic Beanstalk about deployment, load, and configuration issues often appear here\.
+ Review recent environment [change history](using-features.changehistory.md)\. Change history lists all of the configuration changes made to your environments and includes other information, such as which IAM user made changes and which configuration parameters were set\.
+ [Pull logs](using-features.logging.md) to view recent log file entries\. Web server logs contain information about incoming requests and errors\.
+ [Connect to an instance](using-features.ec2connect.md) and check system resources\.
+ [Roll back](using-features.deploy-existing-version.md) to a previous working version of the application\.
+ Undo recent configuration changes or restore a [saved configuration](environment-configuration-methods-before.md#configuration-options-before-savedconfig)\.
+ Deploy a new environment\. If the environment appears healthy, perform a [CNAME swap](using-features.CNAMESwap.md) to route traffic to the new environment and continue to debug the earlier one\.
