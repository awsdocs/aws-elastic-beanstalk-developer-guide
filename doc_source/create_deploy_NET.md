# Creating and Deploying Elastic Beanstalk Applications in \.NET Using AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio<a name="create_deploy_NET"></a>

Elastic Beanstalk for \.NET makes it easier to deploy, manage, and scale your ASP\.NET web applications that use Amazon Web Services\. Elastic Beanstalk for \.NET is available to anyone who is developing or hosting a web application that uses IIS\.

**Get started now**: To get started with a tutorial, you can go directly to [Tutorial: How to Deploy a \.NET Sample Application Using AWS Elastic Beanstalk](create_deploy_NET.quickstart.md)\. In this tutorial, you will deploy a sample ASP\.NET Web Application to an AWS Elastic Beanstalk application container\.

The rest of this section presents instructions for creating, testing, deploying, and redeploying your ASP\.NET web application to Elastic Beanstalk using the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio\. The second part explains how to manage and configure your applications and environments using the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio\. For more information about prerequisites, installation instructions, and running code samples, go to the [AWS Toolkit for Microsoft Visual Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/visualstudio/)\. This site also provides useful information about tools, how\-to topics, and additional resources for ASP\.NET developers\.

**Note**  
This platform does not support worker environments, enhanced health reporting, managed updates, bundle logs or immutable updates\.

The topics in this chapter assume some knowledge of Elastic Beanstalk environments\. If you haven't used Elastic Beanstalk before, try the [getting started tutorial](GettingStarted.md) to learn the basics\.
