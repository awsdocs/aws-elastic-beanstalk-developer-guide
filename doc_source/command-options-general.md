## aws:autoscaling:asg<a name="command-options-general-autoscalingasg"></a>

Configure your environment's Auto Scaling group\.


**Namespace: `aws:autoscaling:asg`**  

|  **Name**  |  **Description**  |  **Default**  |  **Valid Values**  | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|  Availability Zones  |  Availability Zones \(AZs\) are distinct locations within a region that are engineered to be isolated from failures in other AZs and provide inexpensive, low\-latency network connectivity to other AZs in the same region\. Choose the number of AZs for your instances\.  |  `Any`  |  `Any` `Any 1` `Any 2` `Any 3`  | 
|  Cooldown  |  Cooldown periods help to prevent Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling from initiating additional scaling activities before the effects of previous activities are visible\.  |   `360`   |  `0` to `10000`  | 
|  Custom Availability Zones  |  Define the AZs for your instances\.  |  None  |   `us-east-1a`   `us-east-1b`   `us-east-1c`   `us-east-1d`   `us-east-1e`   `eu-central-1`   | 
|  MinSize  |  Minimum number of instances you want in your Auto Scaling group\.  |   `1`   |  `1` to `10000`  | 
|  MaxSize  |  Maximum number of instances you want in your Auto Scaling group\.  |   `4`   |  `1` to `10000`  | 

## aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration<a name="command-options-general-autoscalinglaunchconfiguration"></a>

Configure your environment's EC2 instances\.


**Namespace: `aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration`**  

|  **Name**  |  **Description**  |  **Default**  |  **Valid Values**  | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|  EC2KeyName  |  A key pair enables you to securely log into your EC2 instance\.  If you use the Elastic Beanstalk console to create an environment, you can't set this option in a [configuration file](ebextensions.md)\. The console overrides this option with a [recommended value](command-options.md#configuration-options-recommendedvalues)\.   |  None  |   | 
|  IamInstanceProfile  |  An instance profile enables AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) users and AWS services to access temporary security credentials to make AWS API calls\. Specify the instance profile's name or its ARN\. Examples: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/command-options-general.html)  If you use the Elastic Beanstalk console or EB CLI to create an environment, you can't set this option in a [configuration file](ebextensions.md)\. The console and EB CLI override this option with a [recommended value](command-options.md#configuration-options-recommendedvalues)\.   |  None  |  Instance profile name or ARN  | 
|  ImageId  |  You can override the default Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\) by specifying your own custom AMI ID\. Example: `ami-1f316660`  |  None  |   | 
|   InstanceType  |  The instance type used to run your application in an Elastic Beanstalk environment\. The instance types available depend on platform, solution stack \(configuration\) and region\. To get a list of available instance types for your solution stack of choice, use the [DescribeConfigurationOptions ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/api/API_DescribeConfigurationOptions.html)action in the API, [describe\-configuration\-options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elasticbeanstalk/describe-configuration-options.html) command in the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)\. For example, the following command lists the available instance types for version 1\.4\.3 of the PHP 5\.6 stack in the current region: $ `aws elasticbeanstalk describe-configuration-options --options Namespace=aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration,OptionName=InstanceType --solution-stack-name "64bit Amazon Linux 2015.03 v1.4.3 running PHP 5.6"`  If you use the Elastic Beanstalk console or EB CLI to create an environment, you can't set this option in a [configuration file](ebextensions.md)\. The console and EB CLI override this option with a [recommended value](command-options.md#configuration-options-recommendedvalues)\.   |  Region dependent  |  | 
|  MonitoringInterval  |  Interval at which you want Amazon CloudWatch metrics returned\.  |  `5 minute`  |  `1 minute` `5 minute`  | 
|  SecurityGroups  |  Lists the Amazon EC2 security groups to assign to the EC2 instances in the Auto Scaling group in order to define firewall rules for the instances\. You can provide a single string of comma\-separated values that contain the name of existing Amazon EC2 security groups or references to AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup resources created in the template\. Security group names are case sensitive\. If you use [Amazon Virtual Private Cloud](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/) \(Amazon VPC\) with Elastic Beanstalk so that your instances are launched within a virtual private cloud \(VPC\), specify security group IDs instead of security group names\.  |   `elasticbeanstalk-default`   |   | 
|   SSHSourceRestriction  |  Used to lock down SSH access to an environment\. For instance, you can lock down SSH access to the EC2 instances so that only a bastion host can access the instances in the private subnet\. This string takes the following form: `protocol, fromPort, toPort, source_restriction` [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/command-options-general.html) Example: `tcp, 22, 22, 54.240.196.185/32` Example: `tcp, 22, 22, my-security-group` Example \(EC2\-Classic\): `tcp, 22, 22, 123456789012/their-security-group` Example \(VPC\): `tcp, 22, 22, sg-903004f8`  |  None  |   | 
|  BlockDeviceMappings  |  Attach additional Amazon EBS volumes or instance store volumes on all of the instances in the autoscaling group\. When you map instance store volumes you only map the device name to a volume name; when you map Amazon EBS volumes, you can specify the following fields, separated by a colon: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/command-options-general.html) The following example attaches three Amazon EBS volumes, one blank 100GB gp2 volume and one snapshot, one blank 20GB io1 volume with 2000 provisioned IOPS, and an instance store volume `ephemeral0`\. Multiple instance store volumes can be attached if the instance type supports it\.  `/dev/sdj=:100:true:gp2,/dev/sdh=snap-51eef269,/dev/sdi=:20:true:io1:2000,/dev/sdb=ephemeral0`   |  None  |   | 
|  RootVolumeType  |  Volume type \(magnetic, general purpose SSD or provisioned IOPS SSD\) to use for the root Amazon EBS volume attached to your environment's EC2 instances\.  |  Varies per platform\.  |  `standard` for magnetic storage `gp2` for general purpose SSD `io1` for provisioned IOPS SSD  | 
|  RootVolumeSize  |  Storage capacity of the root Amazon EBS volume in whole GB\. Required if you set `RootVolumeType` to provisioned IOPS SSD\. For example, `"64"`\.  |  Varies per platform for magnetic storage and general purpose SSD\. None for provisioned IOPS SSD\.  |  `10` to `16384` GB for general purpose and provisioned IOPS SSD\. `8` to `1024` GB for magnetic\.  | 
|  RootVolumeIOPS  |  Desired input/output operations per second \(IOPS\) for a provisioned IOPS SSD root volume\. The maximum ratio of IOPS to volume size is 30 to 1\. For example, a volume with 3000 IOPS must be at least 100 GB\.  |  None  |  `100` to `20000`  | 

## aws:autoscaling:scheduledaction<a name="command-options-general-autoscalingscheduledaction"></a>

Configure [scheduled actions](environments-cfg-autoscaling-scheduledactions.md) for your environment's Auto Scaling group\. For each action, specify a `resource_name` in addition to the option name, namespace, and value for each setting\. See [The aws:autoscaling:scheduledaction Namespace](environments-cfg-autoscaling-scheduledactions.md#environments-cfg-autoscaling-scheduledactions-namespace) for examples\.


**Namespace: `aws:autoscaling:scheduledaction`**  

|  **Name**  |  **Description**  |  **Default**  |  **Valid Values**  | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|  StartTime  |  For one\-time actions, choose the date and time to run the action\. For recurrent actions, choose when to activate the action\.  |  None  |  A [ISO\-8601 timestamp](http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime) unique across all scheduled scaling actions\.  | 
|  EndTime  |  A date and time in the future \(in the UTC/GMT time zone\) when you want the scheduled scaling action to stop repeating\. If you don't specify an **EndTime**, the action recurs according to the `Recurrence` expression\. Example: `2015-04-28T04:07:2Z` When a scheduled action ends, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling does not automatically go back to its previous settings\. Configure a second scheduled action to return to the original settings as needed\.  |  None  |  A [ISO\-8601 timestamp](http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime) unique across all scheduled scaling actions\.  | 
|  MaxSize  |  The maximum instance count to apply when the action runs\.  |  None  |  `0` to `10000`  | 
|  MinSize  |  The minimum instance count to apply when the action runs\.  |  None  |  `0` to `10000`  | 
|  DesiredCapacity  |  Set the initial desired capacity for the Auto Scaling group\. After the scheduled action is applied, triggers will adjust the desired capacity based on their settings\.  |  None  |  `0` to `10000`  | 
|  Recurrence  |  The frequency with which you want the scheduled action to occur\. If you do not specify a recurrence, then the scaling action will occur only once, as specified by the `StartTime`\.  |  None  |  A [Cron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) expression\.  | 
|  Suspend  |  Set to `true` to deactivate a recurrent scheduled action temporarily\.  |   `false`   |   `true`   `false`   | 

## aws:autoscaling:trigger<a name="command-options-general-autoscalingtrigger"></a>

Configure scaling triggers for your environment's Auto Scaling group\.

**Note**  
Three options in this namespace determine how long a trigger's metric can remain beyond its defined limits before the trigger fires\. These options are related as follows:  
`BreachDuration = Period * EvaluationPeriods`  
When you specify any two of these three options, the value of the remaining one is inferred\.


**Namespace: `aws:autoscaling:trigger`**  

|  **Name**  |  **Description**  |  **Default**  |  **Valid Values**  | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|  BreachDuration  |  Amount of time, in minutes, a metric can be beyond its defined limit \(as specified in the `UpperThreshold` and `LowerThreshold`\) before the trigger fires\.  |   `5`   |  `1` to `600`  | 
|  LowerBreachScaleIncrement  |  How many Amazon EC2 instances to remove when performing a scaling activity\.  |   `-1`   |   | 
|  LowerThreshold  |  If the measurement falls below this number for the breach duration, a trigger is fired\.  |   `2000000`   |  `0` to `20000000`  | 
|  MeasureName  |  Metric used for your Auto Scaling trigger\.  |   `NetworkOut`   |   `CPUUtilization`   `NetworkIn`   `NetworkOut`   `DiskWriteOps`   `DiskReadBytes`   `DiskReadOps`   `DiskWriteBytes`   `Latency`   `RequestCount`   `HealthyHostCount`   `UnhealthyHostCount`   `TargetResponseTime`   | 
|  Period  |  Specifies how frequently Amazon CloudWatch measures the metrics for your trigger\. The value is the number of minutes between two consecutive periods\.  |   `5`   |  `1` to `600`  | 
|  EvaluationPeriods  |  The number of consecutive evaluation periods used to determine if a breach is occurring\.  |   `1`   |  `1` to `600`  | 
|  Statistic  |  Statistic the trigger should use, such as `Average`\.  |   `Average`   |   `Minimum`   `Maximum`   `Sum`   `Average`   | 
|  Unit  |  Unit for the trigger measurement, such as `Bytes`\.  |   `Bytes`   |   `Seconds`   `Percent`   `Bytes`   `Bits`   `Count`   `Bytes/Second`   `Bits/Second`   `Count/Second`   `None`   | 
|  UpperBreachScaleIncrement  |  How many Amazon EC2 instances to add when performing a scaling activity\.  |   `1`   |   | 
|  UpperThreshold  |  If the measurement is higher than this number for the breach duration, a trigger is fired\.  |   `6000000`   |  `0` to `20000000`  | 

## aws:autoscaling:updatepolicy:rollingupdate<a name="command-options-general-autoscalingupdatepolicyrollingupdate"></a>

Configure rolling updates your environment's Auto Scaling group\.


**Namespace: `aws:autoscaling:updatepolicy:rollingupdate`**  

|  **Name**  |  **Description**  |  **Default**  |  **Valid Values**  | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|  MaxBatchSize  |  The number of instances included in each batch of the rolling update\.  |  One\-third of the minimum size of the autoscaling group, rounded to the next highest integer\.  |  `1` to `10000`  | 
|  MinInstancesInService  |  The minimum number of instances that must be in service within the autoscaling group while other instances are terminated\.  |  The minimum size of the AutoScaling group or one less than the maximum size of the autoscaling group, whichever is lower\.  |  `0` to `9999`  | 
|  RollingUpdateEnabled  |  If `true`, enables rolling updates for an environment\. Rolling updates are useful when you need to make small, frequent updates to your Elastic Beanstalk software application and you want to avoid application downtime\. Setting this value to true automatically enables the `MaxBatchSize`, `MinInstancesInService`, and `PauseTime` options\. Setting any of those options also automatically sets the `RollingUpdateEnabled` option value to `true`\. Setting this option to `false` disables rolling updates\.  If you use the Elastic Beanstalk console or EB CLI to create an environment, you can't set this option in a [configuration file](ebextensions.md)\. The console and EB CLI override this option with a [recommended value](command-options.md#configuration-options-recommendedvalues)\.   |   `false`   |   `true`   `false`   | 
|  RollingUpdateType  |  Time\-based rolling updates apply a PauseTime between batches\. Health\-based rolling updates wait for new instances to pass health checks before moving on to the next batch\. [Immutable updates](environmentmgmt-updates-immutable.md) launch a full set of instances in a new AutoScaling group\.  If you use the Elastic Beanstalk console or EB CLI to create an environment, you can't set this option in a [configuration file](ebextensions.md)\. The console and EB CLI override this option with a [recommended value](command-options.md#configuration-options-recommendedvalues)\.   |   `Time`   |   `Time`   `Health`  `Immutable`  | 
|  PauseTime  |  The amount of time the Elastic Beanstalk service will wait after it has completed updates to one batch of instances before it continues on to the next batch\.  |  Automatically computed based on instance type and container\.  |  `PT0S`\* \(0 seconds\) to `PT1H` \(1 hour\)  | 
|  Timeout  |  Maximum amount of time to wait for all instances in a batch of instances to pass health checks before canceling the update\.  |  `PT30M` \(30 minutes\)  |  `PT5M`\* \(5 minutes\) to `PT1H` \(1 hour\) \*[ISO8601 duration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations) format: `PT#H#M#S` where each \# is the number of hours, minutes, and/or seconds, respectively\.  | 

## aws:ec2:vpc<a name="command-options-general-ec2vpc"></a>

Configure your environment to launch resources in a custom [Amazon Virtual Private Cloud](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/) \(Amazon VPC\)\. If you don't configure settings in this namespace, Elastic Beanstalk launches resources in the default VPC\.

|  ELBSubnets  |  The IDs of the subnet or subnets for the elastic load balancer\. If you have multiple subnets, specify the value as a single comma\-delimited string of subnet IDs \(for example, `"subnet-11111111,subnet-22222222"`\)\.  |  None  |   | 
|  ELBScheme  |  Specify `internal` if you want to create an internal load balancer in your Amazon VPC so that your Elastic Beanstalk application cannot be accessed from outside your Amazon VPC\. If you specify a value other than `public` or `internal`, Elastic Beanstalk will ignore the value\.  |   `public`   |   `public`   `internal`   | 
|  DBSubnets  |  Contains the IDs of the database subnets\. This is only used if you want to add an Amazon RDS DB Instance as part of your application\. If you have multiple subnets, specify the value as a single comma\-delimited string of subnet IDs \(for example, `"subnet-11111111,subnet-22222222"`\)\.  |  None  |   | 
|  AssociatePublicIpAddress  |  Specifies whether to launch instances with public IP addresses in your Amazon VPC\. Instances with public IP addresses do not require a NAT device to communicate with the Internet\. You must set the value to `true` if you want to include your load balancer and instances in a single public subnet\. `false` setting is not compatible with `SingleInstance` `EnvironmentType` type\. |  None  |   `true`   `false`   | 

## aws:elasticbeanstalk:application<a name="command-options-general-elasticbeanstalkapplication"></a>

|  Application Healthcheck URL  |  The path to which to send health check requests\. If not set, the load balancer attempts to make a TCP connection on port 80 to verify health\. Set to a path starting with `/` to send an HTTP GET request to that path\. You can also include a protocol \(HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, or SSL\) and port prior to the path to check HTTPS connectivity or use a non\-default port\.  If you use the Elastic Beanstalk console to create an environment, you can't set this option in a [configuration file](ebextensions.md)\. The console overrides this option with a [recommended value](command-options.md#configuration-options-recommendedvalues)\.   |  None  |  `/` \(HTTP GET to root path\) `/health` `HTTPS:443/` `HTTPS:443/health` etc  | 

The EB CLI and Elastic Beanstalk console apply recommended values for the preceding options\. You must remove these settings if you want to use configuration files to configure the same\. See [Recommended Values](command-options.md#configuration-options-recommendedvalues) for details\.

## aws:elbv2:listenerrule:rule\_name<a name="command-options-general-elbv2-listenerrule"></a>

Define listener rules for an application load balancer\. If a request matches the host names or paths in a rule, the load balancer forwards it to the specified process\. To use a rule, add it to a listener with the `Rules` option in the [`aws:elbv2:listener:listener_port`](#command-options-general-elbv2-listener) namespace\.
