AWS Elastic Beanstalk for Node\.js makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale your Node\.js web applications using Amazon Web Services\. Elastic Beanstalk for Node\.js is available to anyone developing or hosting a web application using Node\.js\. This chapter provides step\-by\-step instructions for deploying your Node\.js web application to Elastic Beanstalk using the Elastic Beanstalk management console, and provides walkthroughs for common tasks such as database integration and working with the Express framework\.

After you deploy your Elastic Beanstalk application, you can continue to use EB CLI to manage your application and environment, or you can use the Elastic Beanstalk console, AWS CLI, or the APIs\. 

The topics in this chapter assume some knowledge of Elastic Beanstalk environments\. If you haven't used Elastic Beanstalk before, try the [getting started tutorial](GettingStarted.md) to learn the basics\.
